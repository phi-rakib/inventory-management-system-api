# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We are currently in the development phase and have not yet released any stable versions. All versions of the codebase are considered pre-release and may contain unfinished features and potential security vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, we would like to know about it so we can take steps to address it as quickly as possible. Please report any security issues by following the steps below:

1. **Do Not Open a Public Issue**: Please do not create a GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities. This is to prevent public disclosure of the issue before we have had a chance to address it.

2. **Email Us**: Send an email to [mdrakibulhaider.int@gmail.com] with the details of the vulnerability. Include the following information:
   - A description of the vulnerability and its impact.
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
   - Any potential fixes or suggestions you might have.

3. **Expect a Response**: You will receive a response within 48 hours, acknowledging that we have received the report. We will then follow up with you to gather any additional information we might need and provide an estimated timeline for a fix.

4. **Coordinated Disclosure**: Once the vulnerability is fixed, we will coordinate with you on public disclosure. We appreciate your assistance in keeping our project secure.

## Acknowledgments

We appreciate the efforts of the security community in identifying and responsibly disclosing vulnerabilities. Thank you for helping us keep our project safe.
